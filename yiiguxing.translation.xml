      <item value="Implicitly choosing a Looper during Handler construction can lead to bugs where operations are silently lost (if the Handler is not expecting new tasks and quits), crashes (if a handler is sometimes created on a thread without a Looper active), or race conditions, where the thread a handler is associated with is not what the author anticipated. Instead, use an {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} or specify the Looper explicitly, using {@link LoopergetMainLooper}, {link android.view.ViewgetHandler}, or similar. If the implicit thread local behavior is required for compatibility, use {@code new Handler(Looper.myLooper())} to make it clear to readers." />

If this method returns true, the caller should invoke {@link continueSettling(boolean)} on each subsequent frame to continue the motion until it returns false.

A network is classified as metered when the user is sensitive to heavy data usage on that connection due to monetary costs, data limitations or batteryperformance issues. You should check this before doing large data transfers, and warn the user or delay the operation until another network is available." />
