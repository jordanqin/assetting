      <item value="Reads frame data from a GIF image source and decodes it into individual frames for animation * purposes. Image data can be read from either and InputStream source or a byte[]. * * &lt;p&gt;This class is optimized for running animations with the frames, there are no methods to get * individual frame images, only to decode the next frame in the animation sequence. Instead, it * lowers its memory footprint by only housing the minimum data necessary to decode the next frame * in the animation sequence. * * &lt;p&gt;The animation must be manually moved forward using {@link #advance()} before requesting the * next frame. This method must also be called before you request the first frame or an error * will occur. * * &lt;p&gt;Implementation adapted from sample code published in Lyons.
